## Notes: 
- We completed the set up of the Windows Server 2019 Datacenter (Desktop Experience) in class and I ran into no issues during the setup. The hardest part was adding the Server 2019 to the VM due to it being a DVD disc drive and having to add it more manually than I've had to in the past. We had to make sure we had enough GB to add the machine and be able to also use it properly. By following the instructions the task at hand was pretty easy. I ran into no issues while completing the assignment.
