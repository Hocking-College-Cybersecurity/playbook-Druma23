## AI Awareness Reflection
Describe one AI tool (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT Edu, etc.) you explored.  
-AI helped me set up the VS Code by helping me with what to type in order to get python and my Github accounts to tie to it.
- I will verify in the future by seeing if it works and if it does not then I will try to look up a tutorial to verify it.
